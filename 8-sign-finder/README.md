# ðŸ’Ž Sign Finder Challenge

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

In this exercise, you'll create a Node.js app that determines the astrological and zodiac signs for the user based on their birthday.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

- The app should accept 3 integers as inputs: month, day, and year.
  For example, if a user's birthday is June 12, 1990, they would enter "6 12 1990" as the inputs.
- The app should use this 3rd party module to determine the astrological and zodiac signs: https://www.npmjs.com/package/horoscope
- BONUS CHALLENGE (optional): tell the user their birthstone too!
